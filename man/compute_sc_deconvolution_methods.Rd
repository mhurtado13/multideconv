\usage{
compute_sc_deconvolution_methods(
  raw_counts,
  normalized = TRUE,
  methods_sc = c("Autogenes", "BayesPrism", "Bisque", "CPM", "MuSic", "SCDC"),
  sc_object,
  sc_metadata,
  cell_annotations,
  samples_ids,
  name_object,
  n_cores = NULL,
  return = FALSE,
  file_name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw_counts}{A matrix with raw counts (samples as columns and genes symbols as rows)}

\item{normalized}{Boolean value to specify if raw_counts need to be normalized (If no raw_counts are available and argument corresponds to already normalized counts this arguments needs to be set to False)}

\item{methods_sc}{A character vector with the sc-deconvolution methods to run. Default are "Autogenes", "BayesPrism", "Bisque", "CPM", "MuSic", "SCDC"}

\item{sc_object}{A matrix with the counts from scRNAseq object (genes as rows and cells as columns)}

\item{sc_metadata}{Dataframe with metadata from the single cell object. The matrix should include the columns cell_label and sample_label.}

\item{cell_annotations}{A string with the column name with the cell labels (column should be of the same order as in the sc_object)}

\item{samples_ids}{A string with the column name with the samples labels (column should be of the same order as in the sc_object)}

\item{name_object}{Signature name to use in the generated single cell signature for deconvolving the bulk RNAseq data}

\item{n_cores}{Number of cores to use for paralellization. If no number is set, detectCores() - 1 will be set as the number.}

\item{return}{Whether to save or not the csv file with the deconvolution features.}

\item{file_name}{File name for the .csv file to save with the deconvolution results.}
}
\value{
A matrix of deconvolution features across samples from your bulk counts based on the second generation methods.
